These are the projects that I did during my Studies

Credit Risk Scoring with R, Logistic Regression, ROC/AUC, Data Preprocessing
• Built and evaluated a logistic regression model to predict default probability using a credit dataset with demographic
and financial variables.
• Validated model performance using cross-validation and ROC/AUC metrics.
• Explained model coefficients to provide business insights into creditworthiness drivers.


Quantitative Market Risk Assessment | R, Copula Models, GARCH, Monte Carlo Simulation
• Conducted an empirical comparison of multiple Value-at-Risk (VaR) methodologies including GARCH, parametric
estimation, historical simulation, Bayesian inference, and Copula models.
• Utilized Gaussian, Student’s t, Gumbel, Frank, Clayton, and BB1 copulas to capture nonlinear dependencies and tail
risks.
• Simulated portfolio losses via Monte Carlo methods and benchmarked VaR results across all model types.
